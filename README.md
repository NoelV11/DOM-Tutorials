# DOM-Tutorials

This repository is dedicated to learners wanting to get started in DOM Interface programming.The content provided here are based on the concepts of DOM,taught to me in the course 'Internet & Web Programming' in university

##Resources Used:-

- XAMPP Web Server

- Brackets IDE

##Features:-

Though DOM Programming is similar to JavaScript,I personally found JavaScript much more easier to implement and understand.

Example:-
I will be demonstrating the functionality of MouseFunctions.html 

It aims to implement various functions provided by a mouse's interface with the webpage,using DOM language and is similar to the functions used by JavaScript

After clicking on the text,the person interacting with the webpage,gets an alert box

Hop on to the repository to learn more tricks!

Functionality of the Repository:-

->To run on your machine:-

- Download the codes (.html) pages from this repository

- Download and configure the XAMPP Server

- Move the downloaded files to the 'htdocs' folder under C:\XAMPP

- Click on the each to file to view it's practical demonstration


##Improvements:-

I am open towards learning more concepts in DOM,to enhance my Web Programming knowledge.What's included in here is pretty limited

This repository is open to the public,to collaborate and contribute.Get in touch with me and I would be more than happy
